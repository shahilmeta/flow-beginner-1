# Cadence Contract for Gaming Inventory

This project contains a Cadence smart contract designed for managing a gaming inventory on the Flow blockchain. It allows users to add games, including console and mobile games, associated with an account. The contract, along with its transaction and script templates, enables adding new games to the inventory and querying them by account address.

## Contract: `mycoding`

The `mycoding` contract is deployed to manage the gaming inventory. It includes functionality to add and store games linked to user accounts.

### Key Features:

- **Add Game**: Allows adding a new game with details about the console game, mobile game, and the account it is associated with.
- **Game Retrieval**: Enables querying the inventory to retrieve game details by account address.

### Structure:

- `Game`: A structure representing a game, including its name, console game, mobile game, and associated account address.
- `games`: A dictionary mapping account addresses to their respective game.

### Initialization:

The contract initializes with an empty `games` dictionary.

## Transaction Template

The provided transaction template enables users to add a game to their inventory. It requires specifying the game's name, console game, mobile game, and the account address it's linked to.

### Parameters:

- `name`: Name of the game.
- `consoleGame`: The console platform for the game.
- `mobileGame`: The mobile platform version of the game.
- `account`: The account address to associate the game with.

## Script Template

The script allows querying the gaming inventory for a specific account to retrieve the game details.

### Parameters:

- `account`: The account address to query the game details for.

## Usage

1. **Deploy Contract**: Deploy the `mycoding` contract to a Flow account.
2. **Add Game**: Use the transaction template to add a new game to an account's inventory. Specify the game details and the account address.
3. **Query Game**: Utilize the script template to query an account's inventory for their game details.
